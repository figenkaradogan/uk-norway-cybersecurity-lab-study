# UK Cyber Essentials – Technical Security Baseline

Cyber Essentials is a UK government-backed cybersecurity standard
designed to establish a minimum, compliance-focused security baseline.

In this lab, Cyber Essentials was interpreted as a prescriptive control set
aimed at reducing common attack vectors rather than eliminating risk entirely.

## Key Technical Principles Applied

### 1. Network Boundary Protection
- Host-based firewall enabled
- Inbound traffic restricted to essential services
- Default-deny posture for unsolicited inbound connections

### 2. Secure Configuration
- Default services disabled where not required
- Administrative privileges limited to authorised users
- System configuration aligned with baseline security guidance

### 3. Malware Protection
- Windows Defender enabled with real-time protection
- Signature-based detection relied upon as primary control

### 4. Patch Management
- Automatic updates enabled
- Operating system maintained at current patch level

## Security Philosophy

Cyber Essentials prioritises consistency and auditability
over adaptive risk management.

While effective at preventing common commodity attacks,
it may still expose services that are technically compliant
but operationally visible to attackers.
