# uk-norway-cybersecurity-lab-study
A virtual penetration testing lab comparing UK Cyber Essentials and Norwegian NIS2 cybersecurity frameworks.

## Project Overview
This project simulates a penetration testing lab environment to evaluate how cybersecurity regulations in the UK and Norway influence technical system hardening. Two Windows 11 virtual machines were configured to align with:
**Cyber Essentials (UK)** guidelines
**NIS2/NSM (Norway)** regulatory controls

An attacker machine running KaliLinux was used to perform scans, exploit attempts, and vulnerability assessments against both systems using industry-standard tools.
